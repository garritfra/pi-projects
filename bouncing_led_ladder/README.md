# Bouncing LED Ladder

This is my first "real" hardware project for the Pi.
It displays a bar that accends and then decends again.


## Assembly

It uses the following GPIO Pins in this Order: <br>
4, 17, 27, 5, 6, 13, 19, 26, 21, 16 <br>

Each circut has a 220 Ohm resister that connects to ground. <br>
See images for reference.
